# Overview
I've been diving into healthcare data analysis to broaden my skills as a software engineer. The dataset I'm exploring encapsulates patient demographics, disease patterns, and healthcare resource utilization. My aim is to construct a robust software tool using Python and Pandas to extract insights and address predetermined questions from this dataset, contributing to my proficiency in data manipulation and analysis.

# Data Analysis Results

Patient Demographics: Analyzed age, gender distribution, and regional patterns.
Disease Patterns: Identified prevalent diseases and their frequencies.
Healthcare Resource Utilization: Explored average visits, medication prescriptions, and lab tests.
# Development Environment
I employed VSCode as my primary development tool, utilizing Python along with Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
